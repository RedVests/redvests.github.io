<h1>Welcome!</h1>
Welcome to the official red vests page! Now there's some content... Check this cool <a href="redvests.github.io/gamesnake.html">Snake Game</a> that you use a gamepad to control is cool! A on an xbox controller, B on a switch pro controller, or maybe this <a href="lilmessanger.html">Cool Chatroom</a> that really only has 1 room and horrible lag. Well anyway have fun!
